abstract = {We propose a general technique for extracting a larger set of stable information from persistent homology computations than is currently done. The persistent homology algorithm is generally seen as a procedure which starts with a filtered complex and ends with a persistence diagram. This procedure is stable (at least to certain types of pertur- bations of the input), and so using the diagram as a signature of the input - for example, deriving features from it that are then used in machine learning - is a well-justified con- cept. However, these computations also produce a great deal of other potentially useful but unstable information: for example, each point in the diagram corresponds to a specific positive simplex. In addition, the persistence diagram is not stable with respect to other procedures that are employed in practice, such as thresholding a point cloud by density. We recast these problems as real-valued functions which are discontinuous but measur- able, and then observe that convolving such a function with a Lipschitz function produces a Lipschitz function. The resulting stable function is easily estimated. We illustrate this approach with numerous examples and several experiments.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discussion on the adaptation of methods involving the homology concept from algebraic topology to the problem of pattern recognition within point cloud data sets. The proposed approach, called persistence homology, applies on (abstract) simplicial complexes, and in particular to the Vietoris-Rips complex, stemming from an initial point cloud data set. This leads in particular to the notion of persistent Betti numbers, or persistence diagrams or persistence barcodes, that are multisets of intervals on the real line, instead of integer values like the classical Betti numbers. The final section deals with various examples of applications of persistence homology (natural images, organic compounds, viral evolution, time series, and the cosmic web), which have been previously reported in the literature. Persistence barcodes may be seen as pattern signatures. This is a relatively long article (80 pages), which is presented more as a discussion rather than as an article dedicated solely to original results. It will therefore be relatively difficult to understand for a non-specialist in the field. From a theoretical point of view reading the article [G. E. Carlsson, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.

This is so in part because of$\backslash$nnew experimental methods, and in part because of the increase in the availability$\backslash$nof high powered computing technology. It is also clear that the nature of the data$\backslash$nwe are obtaining is significantly different. For example, it is now often the case$\backslash$nthat we are given data in the form of very long vectors, where all but a few of the$\backslash$ncoordinates turn out to be irrelevant to the questions of interest, and further that$\backslash$nwe don't necessarily know which coordinates are the interesting ones. A related$\backslash$nfact is that the data is often very high-dimensional, which severely restricts our$\backslash$nability to visualize it. The data obtained is also often much noisier than in the$\backslash$npast and has more missing information (missing data). This is particularly so in$\backslash$nthe case of biological data, particularly high throughput data from microarray or$\backslash$nother sources. Our ability to analyze this data, both in terms of quantity and the$\backslash$nnature of the data, is clearly not keeping pace with the data being produced. In this$\backslash$npaper, we will discuss how geometry and topology can be applied to make useful$\backslash$ncontributions to the analysis of various kinds of data.

abstract = {Perhaps the most important idea in applied algebraic topology is persistence. It is a response to the first difficulty that one encounters in attempting to assign topological invariants to statistical data sets: that the topology is not robust and has a sensitive dependence on the length scale at which the data set is being considered. The solution is to calculate the topology (specifically the homology) at all scales simultaneously, and to encode the relationship between the different scales in an algebraic invariant called the persistence diagram. The effective algorithm for doing so was published in 2000 by Edelsbrunner, Letscher and Zomorodian [2]. Topological data analysis would not be possible without this tool. Since then, persistence has been developed and understood quite extensively. Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner and Harer [3] proved the important (and nontrivial) theorem that the persistence diagram is stable under perturbations of the initial data. Zomorodian and Carlsson [7] studied persistence algebraically, identifying the points of the persistence diagram with indecomposable summands of a module over the polynomial ring k[t], the monomial t representing a change of scale by a fixed increment. Generalising this approach using polynomial rings with two or more variables, they showed that the corresponding situation with two or more independent length scales is in some sense algebraically intractable, with no complete descriptive invariants available. Carlsson and de Silva [1] showed that persistence can be made to work over " non-monotone " parameters, in contrast to " monotone " parameters such as length scale; this is known as zigzag persistence. Bubenik and Scott [4] have described and studied persistence in terms of category theory. Measured view. In becoming familiar with the literature on persistence, one quickly realises that the existing math-ematical foundations are dependent on certain strong finiteness assumptions. For instance, one can do persistence on the sublevelsets of a function on a compact manifold, but it is usually assumed that the function be a Morse function. This ensures that the resulting persistent data is finite: each sublevelset has finite-dimensional homology, and there are only finitely many essentially distinct levels, separated by the critical points. In computational terms, this is a perfectly natural assumption (a computer can only handle finite data), but for some of the theoretical work this assumption is},

abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of computing topological invariants of geometric objects in a robust manner, using only point cloud data sampled from the object. It is now widely recognised that this kind of topological analysis can give qualitative information about data sets which is not readily available by other means. In particular, it can be an aid to visualisation of high dimensional data. Standard simplicial complexes for approximating the topological type of the underlying space (such as {\v{C}}ech, Rips, or $\alpha$-shape) produce simplicial complexes whose vertex set has the same size as the underlying set of point cloud data. Such constructions are sometimes still tractable, but are wasteful (of computing resources) since the homotopy types of the underlying objects are generally realisable on much smaller vertex sets. We obtain smaller complexes by choosing a set of ‘landmark' points from our data set, and then constructing a “witness complex” on this set using ideas motivated by the usual Delaunay complex in Euclidean space. The key idea is that the remaining (non-landmark) data points are used as witnesses to the existence of edges or simplices spanned by combinations of landmark points. Our construction generalises the topology-preserving graphs of Martinetz and Schulten [MS94] in two direc- tions. First, it produces a simplicial complex rather than a graph. Secondly it actually produces a nested family of simplicial complexes, which represent the data at different feature scales, suitable for calculating persistent homology [ELZ00, ZC04]. We find that in addition to the complexes being smaller, they also provide (in a precise sense) a better picture of the homology, with less noise, than the full scale constructions using all the data points. We illustrate the use of these complexes in qualitatively analyzing a data set of 3×3 pixel patches studied by David Mumford et al [LPM03].},

On sait que la th{\'{e}}orie axiomatique de l'homologie due {\`{a}} Eilenberg et Steenrod a d{\'{e}}j{\`{a}} utilis{\'{e}}e avec succ{\`{e}}s par divers auteurs; le pr{\'{e}}sent livre en donne la premi{\`{e}}re exposition compl{\`{e}}te. Cette conception axiomatique commande tout le d{\'{e}}veloppement de l'ouvrage. Dans un premier bloc de 3 chapitres, les axiomes g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}raux sont expos{\'{e}}s, et il est prouv{\'{e}} que le groupe de coefficients de la th{\'{e}}orie d{\'{e}}termine enti{\`{e}}rement celle-ci sur la cat{\'{e}}gorie des espaces admettant une d{\'{e}}composition simpliciale finie. Aucun th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me d'existence n'est encore d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}}: on n'exhibera explicitement des th{\'{e}}ories satisfaisant aux axiomes que dans les Chapitres VI, VII, et IX. Notons que, d{\`{e}}s la fin du Chap. I, les groupes d'homologie des sph{\`{e}}res sont d{\'{e}}termin{\'{e}}s et le th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me de Mayer-Vietoris {\'{e}}tabli comme simples cons{\'{e}}quences des axiomes. Le Chap. II est consacr{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}tude g{\'{e}}om{\'{e}}trique des complexes simpliciaux. Au Chap. III, les axiomes conduisent, dans le cas d'un espace pourvu d'une d{\'{e}}composition simpliciale, {\`{a}} introduire les notions de cha{\^{i}}ne, d'orientation, de bord, de cycle, etc. Essentiellement, trois th{\'{e}}ories de l'homologie seront pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}es dans la suite du livre: l'homologie des complexes simpliciaux, finis ou infinis (Chap. VI); la th{\'{e}}orie singuli{\`{e}}re d'Eilenberg (Chap. VII); la th{\'{e}}orie de {\v{C}}ech (Chap. IX et X). Auparavant, on a besoin de deux chapitres pr{\'{e}}paratoires (IV et V): le premier est consacr{\'{e}} {\`{a}} un expos{\'{e}} sommaire des notions g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rales sur les cat{\'{e}}gories et les foncteurs (au sens d'Eilenberg-MacLane); le deuxi{\`{e}}me est un chapitre d'alg{\`{e}}bre o{\`{u}} l'on traite des "complexes de cha{\^{i}}nes'' en g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral, et o{\`{u}} le lecteur trouvera aussi des notions sur les groupes ab{\'{e}}liens libres, le produit tensoriel de deux modules C et G, le module des homomorphismes Hom(C,G), la comparaison des groupes d'homologie et de cohomologie relatifs {\`{a}} divers groupes de coefficients. Les Chapitres VIII, IX, X constituent un bloc compact de 86 pages sur la th{\'{e}}orie de {\v{C}}ech. Le Chap. VIII traite des limites inductives et limites projectives (direct limits, inverse limits), dont l'int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t n'est d'ailleurs pas limit{\'{e}} {\`{a}} la th{\'{e}}orie de {\v{C}}ech. Au Chap. IX nous trouvons la th{\'{e}}orie de {\v{C}}ech pour des espaces g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}raux, au moyen de recouvrements quelconques (Dowker). Le rapporteur pense qu'on aurait pu se contenter d'exposer la th{\'{e}}orie de la cohomologie de {\v{C}}ech: en effet la th{\'{e}}orie de l'homologie {\`{a}} coefficients dans un groupe compact G (la seule qui satisfasse {\`{a}} l'"axiome d'exactitude'') ne peut donner d'autres invariants topologiques que la cohomologie {\`{a}} coefficients dans le groupe discret, dual de G. Au Chap. X, on montre que, pour la cat{\'{e}}gorie des espaces compacts, l'"axiome de continuit{\'{e}}'' caract{\'{e}}rise la th{\'{e}}orie de {\v{C}}ech parmi toutes les th{\'{e}}ories possibles; puis on donne deux autres th{\'{e}}ories "de {\v{C}}ech'', dont l'une est essentiellement la "cohomologie de {\v{C}}ech {\`{a}} supports compacts'' pour un espace localement compact. Le livre pr{\'{e}}sente quelques traits particuliers dignes d'{\^{e}}tre signal{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} l'attention des lecteurs. Il n'y a pas de liste bibliographique; mais {\`{a}} la fin de chaque chapitre on trouve des "Notes'' qui contiennent {\'{e}}ventuellement des indications sur le d{\'{e}}veloppement historique, et des compl{\'{e}}ments souvent tr{\`{e}}s suggestifs. En outre, chaque chapitre est suivi d'exercices dont le but est double: ils permettent au lecteur de s'assurer qu'il a assimil{\'{e}} le texte, mais ils donnent aussi aux auteurs l'occasion de compl{\'{e}}ter celui-ci sur des points int{\'{e}}ressants. Le livre est riche en diagrammes: la technique des diagrammes est devenue un auxiliaire presque indispensable en alg{\`{e}}bre homologique. Signalons, entre autres d{\'{e}}tails int{\'{e}}ressants: la th{\'{e}}orie des produits dans les complexes simpliciaux (Chap. II), celle du "mapping cylinder'' abstrait (Chap.

abstract = {Topological data analysis is a new approach to analyzing the structure of high dimensional datasets. Persistent homology, specifically, generalizes hierarchical clustering methods to identify significant higher dimensional properties. In this project, we analyze mobile network data from Senegal to determine whether significant topological structure is present. We investigate two inde- pendent questions: whether the introduction of the Dakar motorway has any significant impact on the topological structure of the data, and how communities can be constructed using this method. We consider three independent metrics to compute the persistent homology. In two of these metrics, we see no topological change in the data given the introduction of the motorway; in the remaining metric, we see a possible indication of topological change. The behavior of clustering using the persistent homology calculation is sensitive to the choice of metric, and is similar in one case to the communities computed using modularity maximization.},

abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a fascinating branch of computational intelligence with much potential for use in many application areas. The fundamental principle of EAs is to use ideas inspired by the biological mechanisms observed in nature, such as selection and genetic changes, to find the best solution for a given optimization problem. Generally, EAs use iterative processes, by growing a population of solutions selected in a guided random search and using parallel processing, in order to achieve a desired result. Such population based approaches, for example particle swarm and ant colony optimization (inspired from biology), are among the most popular metaheuristic methods being used in machine learning, along with others such as the simulated annealing (inspired from thermodynamics). In this paper, we provide a short survey on the state-of-the-art of EAs, beginning with some background on the theory of evolution and contrasting the original ideas of Darwin and Lamarck; we then continue with a discussion on the analogy between biological and computational sciences, and briefly describe some fundamentals of EAs, including the Genetic Algorithms, Genetic Programming, Evolution Strategies, Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (i.e., Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Bacteria Foraging Algorithms, Bees Algorithm, Invasive Weed Optimization), Memetic Search, Differential Evolution Search, Artificial Immune Systems, Gravitational Search Algorithm, Intelligent Water Drops Algorithm. We conclude with a short description of the usefulness of EAs for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining tasks and present some open problems and challenges to further stimulate research.},

These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel enabling a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in modeling the non-Gaussian structures of natural images. However, despite the many advances in the direction of sparse coding and multi-resolution analysis, the full probability distribution of pixel values in a neighborhood has not yet been described. In this study, we explore the space of data points representing the values of 3 × 3 high-contrast patches from optical and 3D range images. We find that the distribution of data is extremely “sparse” with the majority of the data points concentrated in clusters and non-linear low-dimensional manifolds. Furthermore, a detailed study of probability densities allows us to systematically distinguish between images of different modalities (optical versus range), which otherwise display similar marginal distributions. Our work indicates the importance of studying the full probability distribution of natural images, not just marginals, and the need to understand the intrinsic dimensionality and nature of the data. We believe that object-like structures in the world and the sensor properties of the probing device generate observations that are concentrated along predictable shapes in state space. Our study of natural image statistics accounts for local geometries (such as edges) in natural scenes, but does not impose such strong assumptions on the data as independent components or sparse coding by linear change of bases.},

Through this hybrid method, we often find subgroups in data sets that traditional methodologies fail to find. Our method also permits the analysis of individual data sets as well as the analysis of relationships between related data sets. We illustrate the use of our method by applying it to three very different kinds of data, namely gene expression from breast tumors, voting data from the United States House of Representatives and player performance data from the NBA, in each case finding stratifications of the data which are more refined than those produced by standard methods.},

We apply this methodology to quantifying periodicity in synthetic data sets, and compare the results with those obtained using state-of-the-art methods in gene expression analysis.

abstract = {Topological approaches to studying equivalence classes of trajectories in a configuration space have recently received attention in robotics since they allow a robot to reason about trajectories at a high level of abstraction. While recent work has approached the problem of topological motion planning under the assumption that the configuration space and obsta- cles within it are explicitly described in a noise-free manner, we focus on trajectory classification and present a sampling- based approach which can handle noise, which is applicable to general configuration spaces and which relies only on the availability of collision free samples. Unlike previous sampling- based approaches in robotics which use graphs to capture information about the path-connectedness of a configuration space, we construct a multiscale approximation of neighbor- hoods of the collision free configurations based on filtrations of simplicial complexes. Our approach thereby extracts additional homological information which is essential for a topological trajectory classification. By computing a basis for the first persistent homology groups, we obtain a multiscale classification algorithm for trajectories in configuration spaces of arbitrary dimension. We furthermore show how an augmented filtration of simplicial complexes based on a cost function can be defined to incorporate additional constraints. We present an evaluation of our approach in 2, 3, 4 and 6 dimensional configuration spaces in simulation and using a Baxter robot.},

In this paper we explore the statistical power of the persistent homology rank functions. For a point pattern X we construct a filtration of spaces by taking the union of balls of radius a centred on points in X, Xa=∪x∈XB(x,a). The rank function $\beta$k(X):((a,b)∈R2:a≤b)→R is then defined by $\beta$k(X)(a,b)=rank($\iota$*:Hk(Xa)→Hk(Xb)) where $\iota$* is the induced map on homology from the inclusion map on spaces. We consider the rank functions as lying in a Hilbert space and show that under reasonable conditions the rank functions from multiple simulations or experiments will lie in an affine subspace. This enables us to perform functional principal component analysis which we apply to experimental data from colloids at different effective temperatures and to sphere packings with different volume fractions. We also investigate the potential of rank functions in providing a test of complete spatial randomness of 2D point patterns using the distances to an empirically computed mean rank function of binomial point patterns in the unit square.},

Of course, this is false, as a glance at the books of Hilton and Wylie, Maunder, Munkres, and Schubert reveals. Still, the canard does reflect some truth. Too often one finds too much generality and too little attention to details. There are two types of obstacle for the student learning algebraic topology. The first is the formidable array of new techniques (e. g. , most students know very little homological algebra); the second obstacle is that the basic defini tions have been so abstracted that their geometric or analytic origins have been obscured. I have tried to overcome these barriers. In the first instance, new definitions are introduced only when needed (e. g. , homology with coeffi cients and cohomology are deferred until after the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms have been verified for the three homology theories we treat-singular, sim plicial, and cellular). Moreover, many exercises are given to help the reader assimilate material. In the second instance, important definitions are often accompanied by an informal discussion describing their origins (e. g. , winding numbers are discussed before computing 1tl (Sl), Green's theorem occurs before defining homology, and differential forms appear before introducing cohomology). We assume that the reader has had a first course in point-set topology, but we do discuss quotient spaces, path connectedness, and function spaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for dynamical analysis of human actions from 3D motion capture data using topological data analysis. We model human actions using the topological features of the attractor of the dynamical system. We reconstruct the phase-space of time series corresponding to actions using time-delay embedding, and compute the persistent homology of the phase-space reconstruction. In order to better represent the topological properties of the phase-space, we incorporate the temporal adjacency information when computing the homology groups. The persistence of these homology groups encoded using persistence diagrams are used as features for the actions. Our experiments with action recognition using these features demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other baseline methods.},

abstract = {Persistent homology is a mathematical tool from topological data analysis. It performs multi-scale analysis on a set of points and identifies clusters, holes, and voids therein. These latter topological structures complement standard feature representations, making persistent homology an attractive feature extractor for artificial intelligence. Research on persistent homology for AI is in its infancy, and is currently hindered by two issues: the lack of an accessible introduction to AI researchers, and the paucity of applications. In response, the first part of this paper presents a tutorial on persistent homology specifically aimed at a broader audience without sacrificing mathematical rigor. The second part contains one of the first applications of persistent homology to natural language processing. Specifically, our Similarity Filtration with Time Skeleton (SIFTS) algorithm identifies holes that can be interpreted as semantic "tie-backs" in a text document, providing a new document structure representation. We illustrate our algorithm on documents ranging from nursery rhymes to novels, and on a corpus with child and adolescent writings.},
